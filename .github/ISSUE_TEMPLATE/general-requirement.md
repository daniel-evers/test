# Description

Describe the requirement here in simple and comprehensible terms. Keep it as brief short as possible without omitting crucial important details. For example, you can write the request in the form of a [user story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story).

Please use English at least for simple issues. However, you can also write in German.

# Verification

Explicitly list all characteristics and criteria that are to be used to check the successful implementation of the requirement. Please do not use phrases such as "see above description". Instead, write down a list of verifiable features, for example.

# Subordinates

As soon as the description of the requirement itself or its verification becomes too complicated, please create subordinate requirements in the form of one or more additional issues. To maintain the context, list these here as [task list](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/about-task-lists).

- [ ] Reference 1 to a subordinate requirement
- [ ] Reference 2 to a subordinate requirement
