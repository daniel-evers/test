# Description

Describe the requirement here in simple and comprehensible terms. Keep it as brief as possible without omitting crucial details. For example, you can write the request in the form of a [user story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story).

Please use English at least for simple issues. However, you can also write in German.

# Verification

Explicitly list all characteristics and criteria that are to be used to verify the successful implementation of the requirement. Please do not use phrases such as "see above description". Instead, write down a list of verifiable characteristics, for example.

# Dependencies

As soon as the comprehensible specification of the requirement becomes too complicated here, divide it into additional (requirement) issues. To maintain the context, list these here as [task list](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/about-task-lists).

- [ ] Reference to parallel (requirement) issue
- [ ] Reference to subordinate (requirement) issue
- [ ] and so on
